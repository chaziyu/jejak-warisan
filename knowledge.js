1. Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad
 Constructed 1894-1897; Architects AC
 Norman, RAJ Bidwell, CE Spooner and AB
 Hubback (for the interior);
Cost $198,000 (Straits
 Dollars)
This was the Government Offices of the
 British Colonial administration.
The original
 building, built in the shape of the letter E has a
 front façade facing the padang (this was the Parade
 Ground which is now called Dataran Merdeka).
At
 480ft in length, the two storey building has a wide
 arched colonnade running around both floors with
 seven staircases and a massive porch and entrance
 hall with its marble staircase in the centre.
It was
 the largest building of its day, constructed entirely
 of brick and plaster.
The imposing clock tower rises to over 140ft
 high with a copper dome and presents a dramatic
 setting for this historic civic quarter.
The one-ton-
 bell clock was set to strike the hour and half hour
 and had a four-sided opal glass dial 8 feet in
 diameter.
This clock was first heard during Queen
 Victoria's birthday parade in 1897.
It was reported that over 400,000,00 bricks,
 2,500 barrels of cement, 18,000 pikuls of lime, 4,000
 cubic yards of sand, 5,000 lbs of copper, 50,000 tons
 of steel and iron, and about 30,000 cubic feet of
 timber were used in its construction.
Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad was originally
 known as the new Government Officers and it
 housed the PWD, Survey Office, Treasury, Post and
 Telegraph Offices and some other deparments of
 the Federated Malay States (FMS).
Over time was
 modified in response to demands for mor space and
 the impact of adding in new services such as air-
 conditioning.
In 1979, it was handed over to the
 Justice Department and in 1984, it was reopened
 having been refurbished and renovated extensively
 to accommodate the Federal and High Courts.
In
 2008, it was taken over by the Ministry of Culture,
 Arts and Heritage and restored and it now holds the
 offices of the National Heritage Department.
Look for the plaque at the entrance which
 declares AC Norman as the architect.
Nevertheless
 RAJ Bidwell, the Chief Draughtsman, is commonly
 recognised as carrying out the design, while CE
 Spooner who was the State Engineer and Director
 of the Public Works Department (PWD) which
 today is Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR) is credited with
 suggesting the use of the 'Mahometan' sic style.
This
 type of architecture came from India wher several
 major buildings had been built in this style.
If you look carefully beside the main entrance
 porch, you will see just the tops of the granite
 bollards which would have been used originally for
 tethering horses.
They appear to be sunken but this
 is only because the road level today is now much
 higher.
This is one of an ensemble of several
 buildings around the padang which make up this
 historic civic quarter, with the majority of buildings
 constructed between the late 1890s and the 1910s.
2. Old Post Office
Now used for the offices of Kementerian
 Pelancongan dan Kebudayaan (Ministry of Tourism
 and Culture).
was built between 1904 and 1907.
 Designed by Architect AB Hubback and built at a
 cost of $100,000 (Straits Dollars), it remained the
 General Post Office until 1984 when the post office
 was relocated to the Dayabumi Complex.
In 1991.
 the building was renovated and used as the Court
 of Appeal.
The style of this building is similar to that of
 the Sultan Abdul Samad building, with wide arcaded
 verandahs of pointed horse-shoe arches.

best viewed from the Padang looking towards the
 building and the many sided stair towers flank both
 ends of this façade.
A little known piece of history is that this site
 was originally a shop premises owned by Towkay
 Loke Yew and occupied by Chow Kit & Co since
 1892. In the exchange of land with the government,
 Loke Yew was given a 30 year lease of the site along
 Market Street (Lebuh Pasar Besar) and Holland
 Road (Jalan Mahkamah Persekutuan) to Clarke
 Street (Jalan Mahkamah Tinggi) where he built two
 properties, the Loke Yew Building and another for
 the Chow Kit & Co European grocery and general
 store.
3. Wisma Straits Trading, Loke Yew
 Building & Chow Kit & Co. Building
The vehicular entrance to Wisma Straits
 Trading is from Jalan Mahkamah Tinggi, although
 its front faces Lebuh Pasar Besar.
A pre-WW2
 building, it went through a major refurbishment in
 the early 2000s and is now a seven storey modern
 building which houses many legal firms with retail
 on the ground floor.
The Straits Trading Company
 was originally established by James Sword and
 Herman Mihlinghaus in 1887 the main point for
 delivery and sale of tin ore for export.
It eventually
 became one of the largest tin smelters in the world.
Towkay Loke Yew (b. 1846, d. 1917) was one of the
 first to send his ore to the Straits Trading Company
 and by 1901 he had built up a substantial holding
 and in 1906 he became a director of the company.
Beside Wisma Straits Trading is the Loke
 Yew Building. The original three-storey building
 from the early 1900s at one time had housed John
 Little & Co, one of the earliest trading houses in
 the Straits Settlements.
This iconic six-storey Art
 Deco style structure was designed by B.M.
Iversen,
 who also was responsible for many other landmark
 buildings such as the Chinese Assembly Hall and
 the Federal House in Kuala Lumpur.
Located at
 the intersection of Lebuh Pasar Besar and Jalan
 Makhamah Persekutuan, just before the bridge
 across the Klang River, have ensured that the two
 distinctive façades of the Loke Yew Building along
 remain very much part of the visual landscape of
 this part of the city
Immediately next door along the side of the
 Klang River is the Chow Kit & Co. Building.
Built
 between 1904-1906 in Neo-Renaissance style it is
 believed to have been designed by AK Moosden
 who was also responsible for the elaborate designe
 of the block of shophouses on Market Square for
 Towkay Loke Yew.
The Flemish type pediments and
 two arched-window bay windows of the Chow
 Kit & Co. Building show influences from the Low
 Countries in Europe.
In 1982, this building was
adapted for new use as the Industrial Court of
 Malaysia by Ar Dato' Hajeedar Majid.
4. Bridge at Lebuh Pasar Besar and
 Masjid Jamek
Standing on the bridge at Lebuh Pasar Besar
 (originally called Market Street) looking towards
 the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers, is
 the iconic view of Masjid Jamek.
This was the first
 permanent bridge linking the British administrative
 buildings to the commercial district and was built
 across the river in 1883, replacing a felled tree
 trunk.
It was later replaced by a lattice girder metal
 bridge which served the city until the 1990s when
 the modern concrete structure was constructed.
Masjid Jamek was designed by AB Hubback
 and built between 1908-1909 at a cost of $33,500
 (Straits Dollars).
It is located on the site of a Malay
 cemetery and replaced the timer mosque which
 was originally located a little further down on Java
 Street (Jalan Tun Perak).
Masjid Jamek was 40 ft
 deep and 100 ft wide and hd a courtyrd in front 56
 ft deep and 101 ft wide.
It has two identical minarets
 88 ft high and an inner open courtyard.
The roof
 of the building opens into three domes, the centre
 one being 70 ft in height.
The design is said to be
 inspired by by North Indian Moghul mosques with
 their onion domes and minerats.
The distinctive red
 and white masonry bands of the walls mirrored that
 used by AC Norman in the Bangunan Sultan Abdul
 Samad nearby.
The main prayer hall was originally
 surrounded by an open, walled courtyard which has
 since been covered.
Two identical minarets stand at
 88 ft (26.8m) with chatris (umbrella-shaped open
 sided domed cupolas).
The original flooring is
 paved with Doulton tiles designed after the pattern
 of a prayer mat.
The curved steps which lead to
 the water's edge at the confluence of the rever This
 served as the main mosque in Kuala Lumpur city
 centre for Friday prayers until the opening of the
 Masjid Negara in 1965.
5. Medan Pasar & Shophouses
The original township centred around
 Kapitan Yap Ah Loy's large market and gambling
 sheds which was located here.
His house, a large
 wooden structure was located at the end of this
 square.
This was subsequently rebuilt this as the
 first shophouses with to be constructed from brick
 and is believed to have been located where the Sri
 Pacific Hotel is located today.
After his death in
 1885, the market was moved to its current site, and
 his house was also rebuilt with brick and a tiled
 roof, In 1907, followin new Sanitary Board design
 guidelines, the shophouses in this square were
 erected and the ornate diree-storey Neo-classical
 designs with decorative plaster garlands, root-top

--- PAGE 3 ---

gables and balustrades come from that period.
 Later, two Art Deco structures, the Mayban Finance
 Berhad building and the Clock Tower which was
 erected in 1937 to commemorate the coronation
 of King George VI, were built.
The sunburst motif,
 a common Art Deco design, is featured at the base
 of the clocktower.
The brass plaques which declared
 the coronation have since disappeared.
A couple of
 years ago Medan Pasar was turned into a pedestrian-
 only plaza.
6. Sze Ya Temple
This is the oldest traditional Chinese temple
 in the city. It remains very well revered to today.
Originally housed in a small attap hut, the Temple
 was rebuilt in 1882 in brick and tiles.
It comprises
 a main hall and two side halls. Following Feng shui
 principles, it is set at an angle to Jalan Tun HS Lee and
 Lebuh Pudu.
As a result, the temple itself is tucked
 behind the shophouses and is visualluy obscurred.
The origntation also creates the unusual angle of
 the walls, arches and stairways of these buildings.
From Lebuh Pudu, a narrow steep staircase leads
 up to the upper storey where halfway up you could
 get a good view of the temple roof and admire the
 ceramic carp along its ridge.
These stairs used to
 lead to the office of Loh Kim Put, an alamnac man
 who could be consulted for an auspicious day for
 any major event or decision.
Today it leads up to the
SATURDAY, 5 DECEMBER 2015
Jalan Petaling is well known for its many goldsmith
 shops which in times past used to also function as
 pawnshops.
8. Kedai Ubat Kwong Ban Heng
Crossing over to the other side of Jalan Tun
 Perak, stop at No 62, Kedai Ubat Kwong Ban Heng.
Established over 30 years ago, you will find many
 of the traditional fixtures and fittings, glass cabinets
 and shelving have been retained.
The signboard
 over the doorway in front of the shop reflects the
 name of the original owner, and although there
 is now a new proprietor, they have retained the
 name of the shop.
Here you can find out more
 about the different types of traditional herbs and
 medicines which can you can use to cure ailments
 from coughs, to headaches and which help with
 digestion, vertigo, and even reduce stress.
9. Oriental Building
The Oriental Building remains one of Kuala
 Lumpur's distinctive heritage building.
Located
 at the intersection of Jalan Tun Perak and Jalan
 Melaka, it was built in 1932 originally to house the
 Oriental Life Assurance Ltd., on a triangular site of
 approximately 5,000 sq ft. just beside the Gombak
 River.
Designed by A.O.Coltman for Booty
 and Edwards, one of the leading contemporary

hotel which now occupies these shophouses. There
 are two gateways to enter the temple;
from Jalan
 Tun HS Lee or from the lane off Lebuh Pudu.
The
 board at the entrance attributes Kapitan Yap Ah Loy
 as the founder of the temple in 1864. It is dedicated
 to the patron deities of Sin Sze Ya and Si Sze Ya,
 who are said to have guided Yap Ah Loy to victory
 during the Selangor Civil War.
On the central altar
 of the main hall are the statues of Sin Sze Ya and
 Si Sze Ya while an altar to Yap Ah Loy with his
 photograph is to the left.
A Tenple Trust comprising
 12 trustees representing different Chinese clans now
 manage the Temple.
7. The Triangle
Jalan Tun HS Lee (originally High Street)
 and Jalan Petaling meet at Lebuh Pasar Besar.
The
 conjunction of roads forms a triangle which is
 popularly known as the Bangkok Bank Triangle.
Recently, as part of the River of Life project, this
 triangle has been refurbished and this section of
 Jalan Tim H 5 Lee pedestrianised.
Several distinctive
 shophouses such as Syarikat MS Ally Sdn Bhd and
 the former Commercial Press Building are located
 here.
Opposite MS Ally along Lebuh Pasar Besar
 is the unique Old Federal Stores Building which
 spans the entire block with its fanciful façade which
 has garlic shaped ficials and an absence of a five-
 foot way.
Federal Stores was occupied in 1905 by
 Chua Cheng Tuan and Chua Cheng Bok who were
 the founders of the Cycle and Carriage Company
 in 1899 and ho were responsible for importing
 many of the first cars into Malaya.
This section of
architectural practices in Malaya and Singapore, the
 five storey building with a basement rose 85 feet
 high and was the tallest in Kuala Lumpur at that
 time with its curved façade addressing the corner of
 the two streets.
Originally housing Radio Malaya, it
 is now leased by CIMB Bank.
10. Flower Garland Stall
Across the street you can admire some
 beautiful old shophouses such as the Teochew
 Assocaition Building and the Eng Choon Huay
 Kuan which skirt around the foot of Bukit Nanas
 You should cross over and stop at the flower
 garland stall where you can learn how to make a
 traditonal flower garland, or if you like, you can buy
 a bunch of flowers.
11. Masjid India
Masjid India began in 1893 as a timber
 building with an atap roof.
It was located close to
 the Klang River which provided its congregation
 with easy access to water for ablutions before
 prayers.
The 1889 map of Kuala Lumpur shows
 Masjid Kampung Melaka on the site where Masjid
 India is located.
It is believed that as more Indian
 Muslims patronised the mosque, it was also known
 as Masjid Keling and Masjid Chulia.
In 1945, it
 was rebuilt to provide facilities for a congration of
 1,000.
In 1964. it was gazetted as a reserve for a
 mosque and in 1966, a new mosque which could
 accommodate a congregation of 3,500 was opened
 by the Sultan of Selangor.
The masjid is a three-
 storey tructure built in the southern Indian style
with chatris (onion-shaped open sided domed
 cupolas) and arch windows.
The single vertically-
 striped minaret topped by a chatri is intersected by
 three balconies.
Today, prayer service continues to
 be conducted in both Arabic and Tamil languages,
 unlike that of the nearby Masjid Jamek where prayer
 service use Arabic and Malay Jalan Masjid India gets
 its name from the mosque which is located along
 it.
A covered arcade house a large variety of stalls
 and shops selling a range of products from religious
 items, clothing, fabrics, traditional medicines, spices,
 home accessories and of course, local food and
 snacks.
12. P.H.Hendry Royal Jewellers

 Ceylonese gemstones to passengers on visiting cruise
 ships.
He left Galle for Australia in the late 19th
 century, but en route was the victim of a shipwreck

The
 three coats of arms on the company's business card
 attest to the fact that P.H.
Hendry were appointed
 royal jewellers to the Sultans of Selangor, Kelantan
 and Negeri Sembilan in the 1920s.
Their main
 business remains gemstones and dealing in gold,
 silver and platinum.
The Hendry family are also
 well known as philanthropists and supporters of the
 Sinhalese community and are closely linked with
 the Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfields where the
 P.H.
Hendry Memorial Hall is found.
13. The Old City Hall and Panggong
 Bandaraya
Built in 1904, this originally housed the
 Kuala Lumpur Town Hall with its Municipal Offices
 and an Auditorium, both with separate entrances.

AB Hubback it cost $107.000 (Straits
 Dollars) to build. Architecturally it carries through
 the intricate design of the Moghul style and five-
 foot ways of Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad.
le
 has a different roofline formed by pimacles and
 a domed porch with many versions of arches and
 chatris.
An elegant bay window can be seen on
 the façade.
In the 1980s the building was tuyrned
 into various courts of the judicial system.
The
 Auditorium, which is accessed from the side of the
 building beside Sungai Gombak, was for many years
 the only only theatre in Kuala Lumpur.
After mach of
 the building was razed by fire fire in the mid 1980s, it
 underwent major renovations, It is now the venue

A. The buildings around Dataran
 Merdeka (Merdeka Square)
Dataran Merdeka was originally
 known as the Padang. It was the focal point
 of colonial Kuala Lumpur and was used as
 the Parade Ground by the British Colonial
 administration.
Until the early 1990s it was
 a prime location for sports like cricket, as
 well as football and rugby.
In the centre
 of the Square, opposite Bangunan Sultan
 Abdul Samad, three flagpoles commemorate
 the historic event of Merdeka were at the
 stroke of midnight on 31 August 1957, the
 Union Jack was lowered for the last time,
 and Malaya became an independent naton.
Today, beneath the Square is a complex of
 shops and a carpark.
While it is no longer
 used for sports activities, it remains a prime
 verme for many large public events.
On the south side of the Square is a
 100m tall flagpole, reputedly the tallest in the
 world at the time it was built.
At the corner
 of the Square, below the flagpole is the old
 ornamental fountain and horse drinking
 trough.
Designed by Messrs Rosher &
 Company This was imported from England,
 assembled locally and installed in 1897 at a
 cost of $4,000 (Straits Dollars).
Close by on the SE corner of the Square,
 is the Former Standard Chartered Building.
This was the first bank to open a branch
 in Kuala Lumpur in 1888 as the Chartered
 Bank of India, Australia and China.
The bank
 moved to its present site in 1891 because of
 its proximity to the police headquarters on
 Bluff Hill (now Bukit Aman).
This present
 three-storey building was constructed
 between 1908-1909 replacing the earlier
 two-storey structure.
Although it was not
 part of the British civil administration, the
 façade of the building was designed to be
 compatible with the neighbouring Moghul-
 style buildings with arches on the ground
 floor, domes and verandahs which have
 since been enclosed with windows.
During
 the great floods of 1926 the bank's vaults
 were flooded and water rost to Im above
 the floor.
When the flood waters subsided,
 millions of dollars of soggy bank notes were
 laid out on the Padang to dry, under the
 watchful eye of the Police.
In the mid 1990s,
 the building was renovated and opened its
 doors as the National History Museum.
It
 has subsequently been used as a restaurant.
Beside, is the Former Government
 Printing Office. Constructed between 1898
 & 1899 it was designed by AC Norman at
 a cost of $38,000 (Straits Dollars) aided by
 J Russell, who was then the Government
 Printer.
J Russell is part of the family better
 known in Malaysia as the founders of Boh
 Tea.
A key feature of the design of the
 building was the structural support system
 of cast iron columns and trusses which
 allowed for a large open interior which ws
 necessary to house the large printing press
 machines.
In the mid 1980s, the building
 was renovated to house the KL. Memorial
 Library;
presently it is the KL City Gallery.
On the west side of the Square is the
 Royal Selangor Club which was founded
 in 1884 as a social and cricket club for the
 growing expatriate community.
The earliest
 clubhouse was a simple timber structure with
 an attap roof erected near the NE corner
 of the Padang.
Around 1890 it was replaced
 by a two-storey timber building designed
4
THIS KUL CITY: DISCOVER KIWALA LUMPUR
 by AC Norman and relocated to its present
 position on the west side of the Padang.
This
 was subsequently replaced in 1910 with a
 design similar to a mock Tudor building by
 AB Hubback at a cost of $75,000 (Straits
 Dollars).
In 1970 a fire razed a large portion
 of the building and it was rebuilt in 1979
 following a similar Mock Tudor style, this
 time designed by local architect Fong Ying
 Leong at a cost of RM6 million.
The Club is
 affectionately known as "The Spotted Dog".
 after a story that the wife of the Police
 Commissioner used to bring her Dalmation
 dogs to the club.
The Club is also renown as
 the birthplace of the international body of
 over 1,500 cross-country running clubs, the
 Hash House Harries which was founded at
 the Selangor Club in 1938.
On the north side of the Padang is
 the Cathedral of St Mary the Virgin. This
IV. Goverment Offices, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor F.M.S.
Anglican Church was consecrated in 1895.
 Designed by AC Norman in the style of an
 early English Gothic church which is seen in
 the buttresses on the outside of the building,
 it has since been extended at the rear to
 house the Jubilee Hall in 1968 and a new
 hall was subsequently added in the mid
 2000s at the inner of the garden.
If you go
 into the building you should take note of
 the pipe organ and the organ gallery as well
 as the three stained glass windows sited at
 the octagonal end of the chancel.
B. Textile Museum
Constructed 1904-1905; Architect AB
 Hubback; Cost $116,000 (Straits Dollars)
On the corner of Jalan Sultan
 Hishamuddin and Lebuh Pasar Besar,
 opposite the Old Post Office Building is
 the Textile Museum.
Originally built as the
 FMS Railway Offices, it was taken over
 in 1917 by the PWD and now houses the
 Textile Museum.
The façade of the building
 is in keeping with the Moghul style of the
 adjacent buildings with its distinctive red and
 white banding which has been achieved by
 alternating fair-faced bricks with plastered
 bricks.
The main entrance along Jalan Sultan
 Hishamuddin comprises two pilasters that are
 topped by chatris flanked by two octagonal
 towers with a concrete dome surrounded by
 smaller domes.
Former Railway Arches
Beside, is what remains of the old wall
 which marked the end of the North Railway
 Goods Yard.
A section of this 15m wall beside
 the Textile Museum along Lebuh Pasar Besar
 was demolished in July 2015. This wall had
 been kept in memory of of the history of
 the place when the headquarters of what
 is now the AgroBank and the Dayabumi
 Complex was built in the 1980s as part of a
 development project to revitalise parts of the
 historic city centre.
C. OCBC Building
This Art Deco building (1936) was
 the headquarters of the Overseas Chinese
 Banking Corporation (OCBC).
The architect
 was AO Coltman who was also responsible
 for several other iconic buildings in Kuala
 Lumpur including the old RRI Building on
Jalan Ampang and the Oriental Building on
 Jalan Tun Perak which you will pass later
 during this walk.
The design was innovative
 for its time as it provided basement storage
 for bicycles;
this still remains to today
 although it is no longer used for its original
 purpose.
Here the regular spaced windows
 flow along the façades addressing the corners
 of Lebuh Pasar Besar and Jalan Hang Kasturi
 and ends in a tapering stepped pylon with
 a flagpole at the top.
A muted mosaic panel
 runs up the centre of the pylon ending with
 the orginal logo of the bank, a Chinese junk.
D. Central Market
Built in 1936 at a cost of $330,000
 (Straits Dollars), and replacing the older
 market on the same location, this Art Deco
 building served as KL's wholesale wet market
 until the mid 1980s when the wholesale
 market was relocated to an area outside
 the main city centre.
The market itself was
 restored and adapted into an art and culture
 market in 1986. When originally built it was
 the largest room in the city at 120m long x
 60m wide and 7.8m high.
The building is
 splayed to align with the street, wider at one
 end with no two façades being the same.
The
 original building had a dark grey granolithic
 exterior finish with a light green polished
 tiling interior to a height of 6 ft. The windows
 were metal framed with glazed 'Calorex'
 rolled plate glass which transmits only 20%
 of the sun's heat with 60% of daylight;
this
 feature has been retained today and gives

--- PAGE 6 ---

the building a distinctive look. The market
 had modern facilities with a provision of 170
 stalls for fruit and vegetables, 158 stalls for
 fish, another 36 for meat, 27 for pork and
 20 stalls for eggs and poultry, in addition to
 cooling rooms with refrigerators.
Next door
 is Central Square, built as an extension of the
 Central Market development.
This is a post-
 modern building which retains the front
 façade of of the shophouses in its vicinity,
 with its food and retail outlets and on the
 top floor, is the Annex, a contemporary art
 gallery and cultural space.
Today, Central
 Market and Central Square are one of
 KL's popular tourist destinations.
On the
 side of the market, alongside the river, is a
 pedestrian walkway which was the original
 loading area for the wet market.
E. Jalan Yap Ah Loy
Jalan Yap Ah Loy is a short road with
 high historical signifience.
It led to the
 house on Lebuh Pasar Besar. This joins
 onto Jalan Hang Lekiu, originally known as
 Klyne Street.
It was named after the Klyne
 brothers, Malacca-born Eurasians of Dutch
 descent.
John Klyne served as a Surveyor
 in the Straits Settlements while his brother
 FC.
Klyne ran a pharmacy at the junction of
 High Street (Jalan Tun HS Lee) and Klyne
 Street.
At one time almost all legal firms had
 their offices in Klyne Street because of its
 proximity to the Law Courts.
F. Lebuh Ampang
If you are to take a detour down
 this Lebuh Ampang you will find an area
 which still has many Indian restaurants,
 spice and sundry stores and money lenders.
The shophouses along this street exhibit a
 wide range of styles from the more more
 modest looking utilitarian façades with
 simple wooden shutters to the neo-Classical
 with more elaborate features and orantely
 decorated window frames, to the typical
 Art Deco style characterized by strong
 horizontal and vertical lines and geometric
 shapes.
Lebuh Ampang was the street of the
 Chettiar, a south Indian caste of money-
 lenders.
An example of a Chettier house is
 at No 85 which is decorated with glazed
 ceramic tiles of peacock designs.
The peacock
 is the carriage of Lord Muruga who is the
SATURDAY, 5 DECEMBER 2015
Hindu deity of the Chettiar caste. If you
 are lucky and can look into the shophouse,
 you will see the traditional raised platform
 with low benches and chess and an old safe,
 visible expressions of this old activity.
G. Jalan Melaka
Walking up Jalan Melaka towards
 the top end of Jalan Ampang, you will pass
 several major modern buildings such as Bank
 Muamalat on your left which has a banking
 hall built following the design of a traditional
 Malay House.
Next to it is the Etiqa Academy
 (formerly known as Bangunan Dato' Zainal)
 and the Amanahraya building.
H. Selangor Mansion and
 Malayan Mansion
This was a private development by
 United Malay Realty Ltd. The two blocks in
 the vicinity of Masjid India are eight-storey
 buildings with one basement each.
They
 have retail at ground floor level with offices
 at the first floor, and subsequent floors are
 160 residential 3 or 4 bedroom flats.
Selangor
 Mansion was built first at a cost of RM2.5
 million and was completed in 1964, and
 Malayan Mansion after.
It is said that many
 of the people who had lived at the Lorong
 Gombak squatter settlement which had been
 razed a few years previously, were relocated
 to Selangor and Malayan Mansions.
This is
 an early example of mass public housing in
 the newly independent nation of Malaya,
 when Kuala Lumpur was still part of the
 State of Selangor.
I. Wisma Yakin and Songkok Maker
Across from Masjid India is Wisma
 Yakin, an 11-storey building from the early
 1970s.
It was the tallest building in the area
 when first built and was developed by Malay
 entrepreneurs supported by PKNS (Selangor
 State Economic Development Corporation).
It consists of a floor for retail outlets and
 remaining floors for other business activities
 and offices.
It remains the must-go to place
 if you are looking to buy baju Melayu or
 songkok.
You may want to drop by Patiman
 & Anak-anak Sdn Bhd at No 11 Wisma
 Yakin, where En Zulfadli who is in charge
 of the shop will explain the different types
 of songkok.
J. Jalan Melayu
Also known as Malay Street, this was
 named for the Malay settlers who were
 located in this area.
A Malay school was
 originally found in this area at the Jalan
 Masjid India intersetion.
A prominant owner
 from the 1870s was Haji Mohamed Eusop
 bin Abubakar, a sea captain from Terengganu,
 who made his fortune as a rice trader and
 invested in several shophouses along Jalan
 TAR and Jalan Melayu.
Jalan Melayu used
 to be filled with Malay spice factories,
 Indian bakeries and Chinese bicycle shops
 and it continues to have a vibrant mixture
 of businesses to today.
See if you can find
 one of the old wholesale businesses selling
 Kain Pelikat (woven Indian hand-loom
 cotton worn by men as sarong), Goodluck
 Trading Company (established in 1895 on
 Batu Road and moved to Jalan Melayu in
 1965) at No 3-5 Jalan Melayu.
K. Batu Road
Now called Jalan Tuanku Abdul
 Rahman (Jalan TAR), named after the
 nation's first Yang di-Pertuan Agong, this
 road was so named because it began as
 a track through swamps, rice fields and
 coconut estates leading to Batu where
 there was the village, limestone caves and
 tin mines.
By the 1930s this road became a
 busy commercial hub with ethnically diverse
 groups of traders and where all manner
 of trade can be found.
As you exit Jalan
 Melayu to Jalan TAR, you will pass in front
 of a block of shophouses which were built
 between 1915 and 1920. Until a few months
 ago, it was an almost intact block featuring
 fine examples of Neo-classical features.
In
 1915, Towkay Loke Yew constructed No 11-
 19, while Haji Eusop's estate built No 1-9.
Despite being constructed at different times,
 the three storey shophouses share the same
 architectural style with giant order pilasters
 supporting highly devorative pediments
 along the façade which is embellished with
 plaster scrolls and emblems and with bay
 windows which adorn the first floor.
Today
 the two buildings at the corner have been
 demolished and the second but one building
 down the block was demolished many years
 ago.
L. Survey Office
Across from PH Hendry is the Old
 Survey Department. Constructed at a cost
 $150,000 (Straits Dollars) between 1909-
 1910, it was designed by AB Hubback.
Its dramatic 400 ft (121.6m) long arcade
 along Jalan Tun Perak is punctuated by two
 entrances, each with a twin chatri on top
 accentuated by the domed octagonal towers
 flanking both ends of this narrow building.
Sadly, this is now eclipsed by the LRT line
 which runs above and along the street
 alignment.
In the 1980s it was turned into
 the Sessions and Magistrates Courts but are
 currently no longer in use.
M. Old High Court
Constructed 1912-1915, this was
 also designed by AB Hubback and cost
 some $208,000 (Straits Dollars) to build.
It replaced the Supreme Courts which had
 originally been located on Court Hill where
 today Menara Maybank stands.
Here the
 public entrance faces the river and leads
 to a grand inner courtyard from which a
 concrete double staircase leads to the upper
 floor.
The original design of the building
 had four towers each topped with a cuppola
 with decortive buttresses surrounding the
 base and different types of arches linking the
 towers on both floors.
From the mid 1980s
 some of the judicial courts were moved
 into this building.
In the late 2000s after the
 courts moved to their new premises, this has
 been was used by various departments of
 the Ministry of Tourism and Culture.
It now
 stands vacant but expectations are that it
 will be restored for new use by Kraftangan
 Malaysia.

THIS KUL CITY: DISCOVER KWALA LUMPUR
V. Supreme Court & Town Hall, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor F.M.S.
HF
odern Kuala Lumpur has
 its origins in the 1850s when
 the Malay Chief of Klang,
 Raja Abdullah, sent a group
 of Chinese miners up Sungai
 Klang to open new and
 larger tin mines, first at Ampang, and later at
 Pudu and Batu upriver from Klang.
The early miners landed at the
 confluence of Sungai Lumpur (now Sungai
 Gombak), and Sungai Klang and established
 a small trading post on the east bank of
 Sungai Klang around an area which is now
 known as Old Market Square (Lebuh Pasar
 Besar).
This quickly grew into a trading
 village which was a wild frontier town
 plagued by floods, fires, disease and the
 Selangor Civil War (1870-73).
During this
 time, the third Kapitan Cina, Yap Ah Loy,
 emerged as a leader, and he is attributed to
 be responsible for the survival and growth
 of the town between the 1860s and1880s.
In 1880, in view of its strategic
 location, Kuala Lumpur took over from
 Klang as the administrative capital of the
 Selangor state, with Klang remaining the
 royal capital.
Nothing of this earlier period
 remains as all buildings were of wood and
 attap which were destroyed by fire and
 floods.
After the 1881 flood, the British
 administration required that all buildings be
 constructed from brick and tile, separated
 by wider streets to reduce fire and health
 risks.
Land was divided into building plots
 and the two- and three-storey shophouses
 we see today replaced the wood and atap
 buildings which had been destroyed by fire
 in 1881. Yap Ah Loy's house was located on
 the south side and looking onto Old Market
 Square (now Medan Pasar Besar);
today the
 Pacific Express Hotel stands on this site.
A multi-racial community quickly
 grew and settled in various sections of the
 town around Market Square, east of the
 Klang River, which had become the town's
 commercial centre, where the Chinese
 community congregated.
The Malay quarter,
 known as Kampung Rawa, was located
 north, across Java Street (now Jalan Tun
 6
Perak) while the Indian Chettiars and Indian
 Muslim traders set up businesses nearby.
Across the river, on the West side, was the
 focul point of the British administration,
 with new government offices around the
 Padang (now Dataran Merdeka).
The advent of the railway in 1886 from
 Klang to Kuala Lumpur brought further
 prosperity to the town, and in 1896, when
 Kuala Lumpur became the capital of the
 newly formed Federated Malay States, there
 was increased development of buildings
 and the Sanitary Board, the predecessor to
 what is now the Kuala Lumpur City Hall,
 was established to maintain roads, regulate
 new building, and provide amenities such
 as street lighting and removal of nightsoil.
In 1885, iron lamp-posts with kerosene
 lamps, replaced the wooden lamp-posts with
 coconut oil lamps.
The first piped water
 supply was availabile from 1896, from a dam
 in Ampang; electricity arrived in 1906.
The common mode of transport in
 Kuala Lumpur in the early decades of the
 20th century was the rickshaw, with the
 motor car coming into general use after
 World War I.
Mosques, temples, churches and schools
 were built, attesting to the growth of the
 town and its populace.
Yap Ah Loy's temple,
 founded in 1864, was dedicated to the god
 Sze Yeh, who personified the pioneering
 spirit.
The mosque in Kampong Rawa which
 was located on the embankment where near
 Market Square was moved to the site of the
 Malay cemetery on the triangular piece of
 ground where the Klang and Gombak rivers
 converge..
From the small trading post which
 had grown by 1896 to have a population
 of 25,000, Kuala Lumpur had become the
 largest town on Peninsula Malaya by 1939
 with a population of more than 120,000
 with its growth fueled by the economic
 boom from the rubber and tin industries.
In 1957, Kuala Lumpur became the capital
 of the newly independent Federation of
 Malaya.
In 1972, it was declared a city, and
when, in 1974, it was oficially established as
 the Federal Territory, and the Selangor state
 capital moved to Shah Alam.
In 1970, Kuala Lumpur with a
 population of 450,000 was the administrative
 capital of both Malaysia and the State of
 Selangor and covered an area of 35 sq miles
 (90 sq km).
On 1 February 1974, the city
 boundaries were extended to 94 sq miles (243
 sq km).
It was designated Federal Territory
 and remained the capital of the nation, while
 the Selangor State capital moved to Shah
 Alam.
Today Kuala Lumpur has a population
 of approximately 1.6 million.
