## The History of Kuala Lumpur

The origins of modern Kuala Lumpur date back to the 1850s, when Raja Abdullah, the Malay Chief of Klang, dispatched a group of Chinese miners up the Klang River to establish new tin mines. These early settlers landed at the confluence of the Gombak and Klang rivers, where they founded a small trading post.

During the Selangor Civil War (1870-73), Yap Ah Loy, the third Kapitan Cina, rose as a prominent leader and is widely credited with the survival and subsequent growth of the town.

In 1880, Kuala Lumpur replaced Klang as the administrative capital of Selangor. Following a devastating flood and fire in 1881, the British administration mandated that all new buildings be constructed from brick and tile, a pivotal moment in the city's urban development.

A diverse, multi-racial community began to flourish around Market Square. The Chinese community established itself to the east of the Klang River. To the north was the Malay quarter, Kampung Rawa, while Indian Chettiars and Muslim traders set up their businesses nearby. The British administrative center was located on the west side of the river, centered around the Padang.

The arrival of the railway in 1886 spurred further prosperity. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was declared the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States. Following the nation's independence in 1957, it became the capital of the Federation of Malaya. Kuala Lumpur was officially declared a city in 1972 and was established as a Federal Territory in 1974.
